# Tunisian-Fantasy-API
Fantasy sports have been a global phenomenon, with platforms like the Premier League
Fantasy attracting millions of users across the world. In Tunisia, football is more than
just a sport, itâ€™s a passionate event that unites people all over the country. Many Tunisian
fans actively participate in international fantasy leagues, of which the Premier League
Fantasy is among the most popular and highly competitive ones.
Yet, despite this enthusiasm for fantasy sports, there is no dedicated platform for
the Tunisian Ligue 1. This gap presents a unique opportunity to build a country-specific
fantasy sports application tailored to Tunisian fans. By developing the Tunisian Fantasy
API, we aim to provide a platform that not only enhances fan engagement but also
celebrates the rich football culture of Tunisia. This project seeks to bring the excitement
of fantasy sports to the Tunisian Ligue 1, enabling fans to connect with their favorite
teams and players in a more engaging and meaningful way.
